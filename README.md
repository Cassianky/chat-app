# Generative AI App Prototype: Self-Introduction Chatbot
## Overview
This project is a prototype of a Generative AI app that serves as a self-introduction chatbot. Users can interact with the chatbot by asking questions, and the chatbot provides pertinent answers. The application is built using ReactJS for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, Material-UI for the UI components, and React Chatbot Kit for chatbot functionality.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
* ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Material-UI: A popular React UI framework for designing responsive and consistent user interfaces.
### Backend:
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
### Chatbot Functionality:
* React Chatbot Kit: A React library for building chatbot interfaces with ease.

## Project Structure
generative-ai-app/

|-- client/           # Frontend React app

|-- server/           # Node.js server

|-- node_modules/     # Dependency folders

|-- .gitignore        # Git ignore file

|-- README.md         # Project documentation

|-- package.json      # Node.js dependencies

## Setup Instructions
### Frontend (Client)
1. Navigate to the client directory: `cd client`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the React app: `npm start`
4. The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000
### Backend (Server)
1. Navigate to the server directory: `cd server`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the Node.js server: `npm start`
4. The server will run at http://localhost:3001

### Chatbot Functionality
The chatbot functionality is integrated into the React app using React Chatbot Kit. The chatbot responses are generated based on predefined patterns and rules.

## Design Choices
### ReactJS and Material-UI
* ReactJS: Chosen for its component-based architecture, making it easy to manage and update UI elements.
* Material-UI: Provides a set of pre-designed React components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing UI.
### React Chatbot Kit
* Ease of Use: React Chatbot Kit simplifies the process of integrating a chatbot into a React application.
* Customization: Allows customization of chatbot behavior, responses, and appearance.

## Conclusion
This project showcases my skills in building a Generative AI app using modern web development technologies. The combination of ReactJS, Node.js, Material-UI, and React Chatbot Kit results in a user-friendly and interactive self-introduction chatbot.
